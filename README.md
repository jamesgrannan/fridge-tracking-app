# Fridge-It: A Fridge Tracking App

For our final group project at Northcoders we created an app that can track the contents of your fridge and give you notifications when food is going out of date. There are three ways to input food:
- Manually.
- By taking a picture of it and image recognition will determine what it is.
- By scanning a barcode on the food item.
